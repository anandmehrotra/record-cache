# To be able to fetch records from the cache and invalidate records in the cache
# some internal Active Record methods needs to be aliased.
# The downside of using internal methods, is that they may change in different releases,
# hence the following code:
AR_VERSION = 31

	AR_VERSION = 30
if ActiveRecord::VERSION::MAJOR == 3 && ActiveRecord::VERSION::MINOR == 1

	AR_VERSION = 40
